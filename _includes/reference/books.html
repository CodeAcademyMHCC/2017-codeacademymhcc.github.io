      <dd>Excellent books on a wide variety of programming topics, but I've linked to their HTML/CSS section in particular as it's most relevant to the course. The <a href='http://shop.oreilly.com/category/browse-subjects/web-development/javascript.do'>JavaScript</a> portion would be relevant as well. In particular I'd recommend exploring their <a href='http://search.oreilly.com/?q=cookbook&x=0&y=0'>cookbook series</a> as they take a project-based approach to teaching principles and practices. Browsing the <a href='http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596155940.do'>CSS Cookbook</a> table of contents should give you a good sense of what's in store.</dd>

      <dd>These books have more a focus on programming than markup (CSS/HTML) and the most relevant books for this course would be on JavaScript. A bit heady and technical at times, but if this aspect of web development interests you I highly recommend it. <a href='https://www.manning.com/books/secrets-of-the-javascript-ninja-second-edition'>Secrets of the JavaScript Ninja</a> in particular is quite good. So is <a href='https://www.manning.com/books/jquery-in-action-third-edition'>jQuery in Action</a>.</dd>

      <dd>A counterpart to the equally excellent <a href='http://alistapart.com/'>A List Apart</a> blog, these books take in-depth looks at modern web development and design concepts from the perspective of active, successful folks in the indstury. Particularly relevant to this course: <a href='http://abookapart.com/products/css3-for-web-designers'>CSS3 for Web Designers</a>, <a href='http://abookapart.com/products/html5-for-web-designers'>HTML5 for Web Designers</a> and <a href='http://abookapart.com/products/responsive-web-design'>Responsive Web Design</a>.</dd>
