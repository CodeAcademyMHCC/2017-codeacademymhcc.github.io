  <strong>Getting Acquainted with Git &amp; GitHub</strong> — May 15-19, 2017
</p>

<p>Learning version control — also sometimes referred to as source code management (SCM) system — is one of the most valuable skills any developer can learn. Git is currently the mostly widely-used version control system due in no small-part to the popularity of GitHub.</p>

<p>As we collaborate on projects in class and build a portfolio of work we'll be using GitHub extensively. For now we'll focus on the basics of getting up and running with GitHub and familiarize ourselves with some basic <code>git</code> commands in the terminal.</p>
