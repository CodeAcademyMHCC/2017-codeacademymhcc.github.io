# Tools

These are some of the web-based tools we'll use during this course:

- [GitHub](https://github.com)
- [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com)
- [CodePen](http://codepen.io)
- [Thimble](https://thimble.mozilla.org/en-US/)
- [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/)

It will be helpful to create an account for each of these services so we can save and manage projects and examples there.
