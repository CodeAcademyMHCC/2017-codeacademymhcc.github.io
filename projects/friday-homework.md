# Friday/Weekend Homework

This project is going to be a little bit different than what we've done lately. Instead of going through and building a project as a class, you will get to:

- Choose **one** of the 3 projects below to build on your own
- Complete the project as best as you can and push the results to GitHub
- Post a notification in the Slack channel when you're done so I can review

Here are the three different types of projects I'd encourage you to choose from:

- [Grocery List ](/projects/grocery-list)
- [Dice Roller](/projects/dice-roller)
- [Simple Calendar](/projects/simple-calendar)

Read the descriptions for each project for an explanation of what they should do and what approaches you might consider in building them. The projects can be as simple or complex as you like.

Regardless of which project you choose the beginning steps should be the same:

- Create a new repository on GitHub for your project
- Clone it to CodeAnywhere
- Create and link together the necessary files (index.html, style.css, script.js)
- Go through the process of staging, committing and pushing these files back to GitHub as an "initial commit"
- Work on your project!
- Whereever you get with the project, stage, commit and push your changes to GitHub and post a link to your GitHub project in the Slack channel.

I'll review each of your projects over the weekend and contact you with feedback and suggestions.
