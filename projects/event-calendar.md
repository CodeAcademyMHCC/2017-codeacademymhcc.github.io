## Simple Calendar

This project should allow a user to add and remove items to a list of upcoming calendar events. It's probably the most amibitious of the three projects here. The basics should include:

- A form with inputs for adding an event. An event should have a **title** and a **date**. 
- A way to display the events and formatted dates. This can be a list, similar to the grocery list — it's doesn't have to be a calendar with boxes.
- A way to remove/edit/add the events on this list

### Suggestions

- jQuery will make your life easier in terms of listening for events and manipulating the DOM
- You may want to read about the [JavaScript date object here](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_date.asp). The **date** field can simply be a string, but if you want to sort the items in the correct order based on date you'll need to familiarize yourself with how date objects in JavaScript work.
- See the Grocery List project for some other applicalbe suggestions about designing the interface

### Extra Credit
- Make it work on mobile? Incorporate Bootstrap?
- Can you enforace a  rule so that the user can only add dates that are in the future?
- Can you add a feature that calculates the "time until" an event?
- Can you incorporate [jQuery UI](https://jqueryui.com/) and utilize the [Datepicker](https://jqueryui.com/datepicker/)?
